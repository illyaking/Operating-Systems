I am glad that I've updated my computer to Windows 10. One item I am happy Microsoft brought back was the Start button. This function was missing in the previous version on Windows. It was frustrating. I love being able to open a menu of my applications. I love that I can create tiles to access my favorite apps. I am happy that the font size of the Start menu is larger.
Windows 10 made improvements to their Search Bar function. The Search Bar will look for apps on my device. It will also access the Internet for what I am searching for. The Search Bar fuction offers a voice search function called Cortana.
