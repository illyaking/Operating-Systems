I am glad that I have updated my computer to Windows 10. One item I am happy Microsoft brought back was the Start button. This function was missing in the previous version on Windows. It was frustrating. I love being able to open a menu of my applications. I love that I can create tiles to access my favorite apps. I am happy that the font size of the Start menu is larger.
Windows 10 made improvements to their Search Bar function. The Search Bar will look for apps on my device. It will also access the Internet for what I am searching for. The Search Bar function offers a voice search function called Cortana. 
The Settings function is much easier to find than in previous versions. The Settings are in the Start menu on the left. In older versions of Windows, you had to scroll to find the settings. Microsoft added the settings icon for instant access. 
The best thing about Windows 10 is that it was free. The only requirement to having Windows 10 was that I had to have a previous version of Windows. Instead of forcing users to buy Windows 10, Microsoft made it free. I did not relish having to drop another couple of hundred dollars to upgrade my OS.
