I am glad that I've updated my computer to Windows 10. One item I am happy Microsoft brought back was the Start button. This function was missing in the previous version on Windows. It was frustrating. I love being able to open a menu of my applications. I love that I can create tiles to access my favorite apps. I am happy that the font size of the Start menu is larger.
